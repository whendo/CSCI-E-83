    "In the pervious chapter we explored some key properties of time series. Now, we will apply these foundations as we explore basic linear forecasting models. These linear models are used in many forcasting applications. Further, these models are a base on which more advanced time series models are constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will explore two widely used families of models. **Autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) models** are based on the ACF, PACF and differencing properties of time series. Key topics for forecasting models discussed in this lesson include:    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The components that comprise basic autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) models.         \n",
    "3. Statistical properties of these models such as confidence intervals.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponential models** are based on different orders of exponential smoothing of time series. Exponential smoothing models are often a good alternative to the ARIMA family of models. In any particular real-world case either family of models might provide lower forecasting errors. Careful testing is required to determine which family of model is best. A brief treatment of exponential smoothing models can be found in the appendix to this chapter A more complete introduction can be found in Chapter 8 of [Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2021](https://otexts.com/fpp3/).       \n",

We have aleady seen how differencing can remove trend and random walk components of a time series. Integration is the inverse operation of differentiation and therefore provides a useful model for these components.     \n",

    "## Appendix: Exponential Smoothing of Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of using exponential smoothing for time series analysis is an old one, dating at least to use by Weiner in the 1920s. The related idea of moving average filters was developed by Kolmogorov and Zurbenko in the 1940s. Exponential smoothers were used extensively in signal processing in the 1940s. The general idea was expanded by Robert Goodell Brown (1956) and C.E. Holt (1957) and his student P.R. Winters (1960). The higher-order Holt-Winters model accounts for trend and seasonality of time series.      "
